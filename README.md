# MySQL_End-Project_EE_DSML_Navaneeth-Krishnan-S_B1-ADV
MySQL end project of Entri-Elevate DSML

Here I did a project based on Library Management System using MySQL. It keeps 
track all information about books in the library, their cost, status and total 
number of books available in the library

I created a database named library and added six tables to this database.
The queries and analysis I done with these tables are:

1. Retrieve the book title, category, and rental price of all available 
books.
2. List the employee names and their respective salaries in descending 
order of salary.
3. Retrieve the book titles and the corresponding customers who have 
issued those books.
4. Display the total count of books in each category.
5. Retrieve the employee names and their positions for the employees 
whose salaries are above Rs.50,000.
6. List the customer names who registered before 2022-01-01 and have 
not issued any books yet.
7. Display the branch numbers and the total count of employees in each 
branch.
8. Display the names of customers who have issued books in the month 
of June 2023.
9. Retrieve book_title from book table containing history.
10.Retrieve the branch numbers along with the count of employees for 
branches having more than 5 employees.
